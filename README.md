Vue example/playground for microfrontend. Combine multimple vue instances as one app
<hr />

This project/repo combines the admin & user vue app into a single/combine vue app<br />
Which can then be served as a sinle SPA via a webserver after building.

The current version does not contain any routing.<br />
Just "static" vue apps with reactive components like textbox & radio buttons
